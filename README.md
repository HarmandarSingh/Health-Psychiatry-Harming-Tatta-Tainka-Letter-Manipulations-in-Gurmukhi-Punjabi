# Health-Psychiatry-Harming-Tatta-Tainka-Letter-Manipulations-in-Gurmukhi-Punjabi

Our R&amp;D Team humbly proposes and requests for the Punjabi Alphabet is wrongly educated with Tainka Letter, while there is no such Akhara (Letter) as Tainka in the World, but rather it is Tatta, and thus we submit the following Simplified Research Report with Facebook Page Post Discussions as well:

It is discussed more here: [1] Facebook Page Post:  https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0rZrdCvT3CX3i9CzHnY6muZ3EZbzgftNou5vHeUxR7q8iPLNRK22uAy1J3oV1X7mwl&id=109767181447483

The Gurmukhi Punjabi Alphabet needs to be corrected as it keeps Serious Health and Psychiatry Harming Tatta-Tainka Manipulations because there is no such Akhara (Letter) as Tainka in the World, while rather it is Tatta Akhara (Letter), and it seems to harm Millions of People including Students, Teachers, Educators, Media, Broadcast, Publications and Language, Music and Other Means and Uses of Alphabets and Languages.

All of it also needs Serious Attention as Appealed even for International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), while our R&D Team published and submitted multiple Research Papers and Publications as well.

Special Remark on Covid-19 and EK Gurmukhi and Gurbari Theory of Elements with Cymatics Based Systems of Allopathy, Alchemy and Artisan: It is also to be remarked that it, the EK Gurmukhi also unifies Western and Modern Allopathy, Alchemy and Artisan Systems to the Complementary, Alternative and Other Hundreds of Pathy, Therapy and Medicine-Medicinal Systems as well.

Furthermore, the EK Gurmukhi is also based on Wood, Metal, Coal, Charcoal and Biochar Elements, which are used by Baba Vishwakarma, Ramgarhia, Parmar and Other Artisan Communities in the world as well.

It thus raises a very simple question especially in Traditional Theory of Elements, Alphabets, Languages, Music, Alchemy and Healthcare Systems and Streams:

Does any Row of Vowels and/or Consonants linked to Coronavirus and Fire, Thermal and Radiant Energy Systems in the EK Gurmukhi Theory of Elements, Alphabet, Matrix and Language?

Yes, traditionally, the Third Row of Consonants, but is also one of the Most Manipulated Row in the EK Gurmukhi or Punjabi Alphabet, while our R&D Team of EK Gurmukhi Metric Systems have doing research on it, and the Health and Wellness Problems, which it seems to cause health and wellness problems among the users. As the "T" of Indian Continental Alphabets has been manipulated to TK rather than TT (Double of T), and thus Tatta as in the Gurmukhi or Punjabi Alphabet.

"It is also to be remarked here that the EK Gurmukhi Theory of Elements, Alphabet and Matrix seem to have become one of Most Manipulated Alphabet Systems in the World, which does not align to the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) Systems.

Moreover, if or when one is not able to speak and practice this Heat, Fire and Thermal Energy Based Row of Constants, the Third Row of TA-H-TA that also decides the "Matra, the Quantity in the Mantra, the Quality", one may not digest the Heavy Foods, Ghee, Makhan, Almonds, Burfi (Dairy Products with Sweets), and all that is known as the Heavy Diet of Wrestlers, Sportsperson, Players, Farmers, and or the Labor Class in general.

It appears that in recent years these diets, foods, means and or the eatables are almost lost in the Regions of Punjabi and or the Gurmukhi Speaking Regions or Areas, while most of the Incurable Diseases, which Emerges due to Lack of Thermal Energy Based Systems, and it includes the Cancer, AIDS, Sugar, Cholesterol, TB, Indigestion, Acidity, Poor Quality of Sperm and or Egg, and all that extinct the Thermal Life Energy in the Human Body. It also may lead to Degeneration of DNA-RNA and Genetic Systems that are based on the Bio Life Energy, which actually follows the EK Super Sacred Alphabets and or the Languages with the Universal Grammars as its Self-assembling and or the Programming Languages in general.

This kind of Mental and General Health Problems can be present in any Given Language, especially the EK Super Sacred Languages, which leads to abnormalities in the Health Systems, and it also applies to the Music, Harmonics, Cymatics, Beats, and kind of Language Based System, while leading to Degeneration, Decay and or even the Death of the Living Systems, while it also Imbalances the Eco-systems as well. In this context, the Languages can play the Role of Mantra, which good for the Light Energy, and the Maatra or Matra, which is necessary for the Sound Energy Systems, where the Thermal Energy plays the Most Important Role.

The Tatta Akhara also represents the 5th Sign of Zodiac, which is Leo Sign, the Sinh or Singh Rasi Sign, which manages the Abdomen with Solar Plexus and Diaphragm Activity while it is also linked to Khechari Mudra and Creation of Saliva in the Mouth and while it can also Deform, De-shape and Damage the Mouth with Tongue and Teeth and also the Abdomen with Digestive System if or when Wrongly Spoken as is the case in different parts of the world, and it is also Part of WIPO TK as well.

All of it also proposed with Re-Examination and Re-Experimentation with Ancient, Traditional and Modern Medical, Healthcare and Wellness Systems, where Advanced Kundt Tube Experiment is also proposed, while Acoustics and Psychoacoustics with Music, Harmonics and Cymatics is also proposed for Eastern, Western and Blends of Eastern and Western Subjects, Systems and Streams with WIPO, WIPO TK, WIPO Green and WIPO IP, AI and Creative IP with Proposed WIPO Community Unit-Unitary IP and Patent Systems and Streams as well."

Our R&D Team thank you in advance for any help you give us.

With thanks and regards,

Special Remark: It is further based on "One of the Major Findings of the Hypothesis of Philselfology and its Research Projects is that in the Universal (Open, Generic) IP (Intellectual Property) of the Punjabi Alphabet, Language, Linguistic and Grammar (Metric) Systems, the Letter of Tatta is wrongly used rather as a Word of Tainka". 

So, it is termed as the EK Tainka Manipulation in the EK Universal IP as seems to be present in the most of the recent Published Textbooks, Books, Journals, Magazines, and Media Broadcasts both Online and Offline have thus the wrong versions in Publishing, Teaching, Educating, and Training it to the Millions of People Worldwide; the Users and Programmers as well as the Listeners, Viewers, Anchors, Speakers, Orators, Actors, Dramatists, and other Monolingual, Bilingual and Multilingual Metric Systems are also included in it as well.

Thanks for your precious time again!
